# himanZip
A command line file compressor that uses Huffman encoding.

<h3> How to use </h3>
Start off by downloading the compressor. Once downloaded, make it with gcc. 
You can then use the binary on any file with read/write permissions.
Files will be compressed to type .hzip, and can be decompressed with the 
same binary by using the -d flag.
